# Interactive Image Captioning

## Basic architecture

This is a forked repository of the Show, Attend and Tell PyTorch implementation provided by[sgrvinod](https://github.com/sgrvinod/Deep-Tutorials-for-PyTorch). The repository has been modified to accommodate the new dataset and extra features.

## Augmentation methods

See my repository for [Image Captioning Augmentation](https://github.com/aliciaviernes/image-captioning-augmentation).

## Continual Learning

The sparse memory replay was adapted for Image Captioning from [this repository](https://github.com/h3lio5/episodic-lifelong-learning). The relevant publication can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01076v3.pdf) (this is the arXiv paper).
